Who are you ? Your birth name is just your identity.  Who really are you.. What is birth and death cycle.. Where after death.. What is karma.. What is Adhyatma..What is Aatma (Soul) ?\n\nThe materialistic things that this world possesses is innumerable and is infinite and believe me, it is all inside you, yes, within you. That is the real world you need to connect to. The world we live in is all fake. We live here because of the debt of five elements which is the source we are born from. Unless and until you pay their debt you are bound to fall into the cycle of birth and death. The karma will be attached based on your work, thought and behaviour and the same carries forward by letting you take different forms of birth. In order to connect to the inner real world, one must know and understand the real meaning and process of Yoga which is the proper internal breathing. Once you start to do that all the forces of the universe gather to break your path and your will has to be strong enough to let not fall into this materialistic trap. Have faith and belief in supreme power, start the process of Yoga and do your duty as you would on a routine day with good thoughts, the disturbing forces will turn into positive forces and opens up the very universe knowledge within you.\n\nKnow Thyself - Coming Soon\n\nClick here to Subscribe to VickGeek so that you don't miss on future videos : https://goo.gl/FMzvaD\n\nYou can also follow me on Social Media :\nFacebook : https://goo.gl/uuDG8G\n\nInstagram : https://goo.gl/CMd2kY\n\nLike, Share and Subscribe to support my work :)\n\nThanks for watching :)\nTake care everyone\n\n\n#ageditchallenge #artgrid #movietrailer","ChannelTitle":"VickGeek","PublishedDate":"2021-09-23T03:25:13Z","NbLike":20,"NbViews":182,"Duration":86,"ThumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-leN-BiJlBA/mqdefault.jpg","Theme":"Trailer"},"-nBa9Tztk-c":{"Id":"-nBa9Tztk-c","Title":"AZOTE  / Artgrid x Artlist Edit Challenge 2021 / #AGeditchallenge / MOVIE TRAILER  category - 2021","Description":"AZOTE is a movie trailer made for the Edit Challenge 2021 by Artgrid X Artlist\n\nArtgrid x Artlist Edit Challenge - #AGeditchallenge - MOVIE TRAILER  category\n\nWould mankind survive it's own parallel world?

How they're life is going, what would happened if someone died of them.\n\nthe Reason why I join this challenge is: \nI live in near of a old village where the middle age Constructions are still in very good condition, I always wanted to make there a short movie, but never had a budget for the equipment , that's why I want to win this!\n\nEven If I not win this year, I will not give up, and come back next year to try another chance with the knowledge I gained with this Year's Challenge, some day I'm sure my dreams will come true.\n\nAbout me: \nI'm a 19 Y/o Boy who loves working with VFX and SFX, creating my own World's and story's and letting people see my work. I'm working with After effects, Cinema 4d and Premiere since 2013, back then I made 3D dubstep or Minecraft intros with them. My big brother was a big Movie and Series freak, he had read all of the books in our house, back then, that really made him look cool for the 6 year old me, since them I'm trying to be just like him!\n\nI wish every one luck for this years Artgrid x Artlist Edit Challenge!","ChannelTitle":"IMMOLATE","PublishedDate":"2021-09-19T23:49:49Z","NbLike":0,"NbViews":20,"Duration":91,"ThumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BBI3P8YnOTY/mqdefault.jpg","Theme":"Trailer"},"BFc7UZVoA7c":{"Id":"BFc7UZVoA7c","Title":"The Goat Reborn - Artgrid x Artlist Edit Challenge / Movie Trailer #AGeditchallenge","Description":"#AGeditchallenge\n\n\nTrailer for the most anticipated sequel ever.","ChannelTitle":"Costin Modoianu","PublishedDate":"2021-09-22T17:45:57Z","NbLike":0,"NbViews":3,"Duration":62,"ThumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BFc7UZVoA7c/mqdefault.jpg","Theme":"Trailer"},"BHAx3xhJ2m0":{"Id":"BHAx3xhJ2m0","Title":"Awake My Soul | Artgrid x Artlist Edit Challenge | Music Video | #AGeditchallenge","Description":"My music video submission for the Artgrid x Artlist Edit Challenge 2021 #ageditchallenge \n\nThis video shows that there is divinity in every soul.\n\nSong : https://artlist.io/album/4482/awake-my-soul?search=awake-my-soul\n\nFootage : https://artgrid.io/\n\nTimeline Breakdown : https://www.instagram.com/p/CUKYokAADYh/","ChannelTitle":"Bali Creative Freelancer","PublishedDate":"2021-09-23T10:00:08Z","NbLike":4,"NbViews":24,"Duration":187,"ThumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BHAx3xhJ2m0/mqdefault.jpg","Theme":"MusicClip"},"BHoDHcpVOvU":{"Id":"BHoDHcpVOvU","Title":"Artgrid x Artlist Edit Challenge | #AGeditchallenge | Movie Trailer | The Whitest Lie","Description":"A small secluded town of unsuspecting white folk begins to unravel when a lost visitor arrives and slowly reveals that the town's folk are not white...they are all black.\n\nMy submission for the official Artgrid \u0026 Artlist 2021 Edit Challenge.

The virus is too contagious for any human to human contact. The only hope is to send a single astronaut to a planet in our near solar system. The planet is called Eight. \n\nUsing technology that's been devised over the years, the astronaut is able to set up a base, and create a clone using human DNA. Whilst the clone is being grown at the base, the astronaut leaves instructions for when the clone awakens in order for it to carry on a new race of humans. The astronaut then returns back home to live his remaining days on Earth knowing that he's passed the torch on to a new generation of humans.","ChannelTitle":"Tom Evans","PublishedDate":"2021-09-23T09:51:53Z","NbLike":1,"NbViews":11,"Duration":87,"ThumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E3Xz3w2w-nM/mqdefault.jpg","Theme":"Trailer"},"E8QMIq4JTRs":{"Id":"E8QMIq4JTRs","Title":"Artgrid x Artlist Edit Challenge #AGeditchallenge| Movie Trailer| B.A.C.K","Description":"Artgrid x Artlist Edit Challenge\r #AGeditchallenge\nMovie Trailer\nTimeline breakdown:https://www.instagram.com/p/CUFEgD7gNIW/?utm_medium=copy_link\n\nMovie name:B.A.C.K\nStock videos: https://artgrid.io/\nBackground music:https://artlist.io/","ChannelTitle":"Daksh Mahajan","PublishedDate":"2021-09-21T09:32:20Z","NbLike":48,"NbViews":167,"Duration":66,"ThumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E8QMIq4JTRs/mqdefault.jpg","Theme":"Trailer"},"E99Tiq_v1BI":{"Id":"E99Tiq_v1BI","Title":"Artgrid x Artlist Edit Challenge | #AGeditchallenge | Movie Trailer | BONDS","Description":"This is my video submission made for Artgrid x Artlist Edit Challenge 2021 \n\nInspired by Gaspar Noé Films and Zigmund Bauman theory of  \"Liquid Love\"\n#AGeditchallenge","ChannelTitle":"Tania Reza","PublishedDate":"2021-09-23T22:45:16Z","NbLike":0,"NbViews":16,"Duration":91,"ThumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/E99Tiq_v1BI/mqdefault.jpg","Theme":"Trailer"},"EAf2BkRJvwY":{"Id":"EAf2BkRJvwY","Title":"INCEPTION | Film Trailer | #AGeditchallenge","Description":"My entry to #AGeditchallenge\n\nHope you like it.","ChannelTitle":"Genosis","PublishedDate":"2021-09-22T23:06:16Z","NbLike":0,"NbViews":7,"Duration":220,"ThumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EAf2BkRJvwY/mqdefault.jpg","Theme":"Trailer"},"EBxuubvuHVs":{"Id":"EBxuubvuHVs","Title":"The Last Laugh | Artgrid x Artlist Edit Challenge 2021 | Movie Trailer | #AGeditchallenge","Description":"A video submission made for Artgrid x Artlist Edit Challenge 2021 A movie trailer titled The last laugh.\n\nAll music used from @artlist \nAll footage used from @artgrid\n\nThank you \n\n#AGeditchallenge #Artgrid #Artlist","ChannelTitle":"Votive Media","PublishedDate":"2021-08-29T00:45:03Z","NbLike":29,"NbViews":1473,"Duration":94,"ThumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EBxuubvuHVs/mqdefault.jpg","Theme":"Trailer"},"ECARX8DV7Gg":{"Id":"ECARX8DV7Gg","Title":"The Departure | Movie Trailer | #AGeditchallenge | Artgrid x Artlist Edit Challenge","Description":"My Entry into the #AGeditchallenge.

Not only do we showcase our vision, but we also learn and can enhance our skills. My brother send me an Instagram post saying that Artlist had a challenge on telling a story, and I knew I just had to enter. I had many different ideas and things I wanted to do, but then decided on making a Brand Ad based on following ones dreams. Here is why:\n\nWhen we are younger we all have different dreams and people we want to become -- we want to chase these dreams, but we not always can. There can be a million reasons why we should not pursue our dreams and be more realistic, but the question is --- is that the best thing for us? Does it make us happy? \n\nChasing our dreams means we have to give up or miss out on many different things in life, but is it worth it for our own happiness? That's for us individually to decide. Never give up on your dream - what ever it may be!\n\nMy brand Actium is about allowing and helping people to fulfill their dreams -- to turn them into reality. It is important for us to learn that we are allowed to be happy and chase our dreams - we don't always need to follow the 'safe' way. Expressing and finding out who we are is important. At Actium we get into action and help you reach your goal in many different ways. It doesn't matter if you want to become a professional race car driver or an artist.  \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nVideo footage: https://artgrid.io/\nMusic: https://artlist.io/\nSFX: https://artlist.io/sfx/\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHad a blast creating the video and hope you like it!","ChannelTitle":"Sophia Fries","PublishedDate":"2021-09-23T21:48:46Z","NbLike":0,"NbViews":6,"Duration":31,"ThumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/GdzsnIZaRG0/mqdefault.jpg","Theme":"Ad"},"GgFDZVcgp6U":{"Id":"GgFDZVcgp6U","Title":"Artgrid x Artlist Edit Challenge - The Devil You Know movie trailer - #AGeditchallenge","Description":"This is my submission to the Artgrid x Artlist Edit Challenge.

I know this is an editing challenge, but sometimes, great editing is simply in the art of the cut.\n\n\nI tried my best to cut 3 timelines together well enough to understand the story without any dialogue. I only using color grading, pacing, and in camera elements to tell it - And perhaps I out-Nolan'd myself. You tell me - were you able to understand it? If not, spoiler below.\n\n\n----------------------------SPOILER\n\n\nBasically, you have your present, and the past. And within the past, you have the end of that story line being edited into the beginning of that story line. But what is the story line?\n\n\nSimply put, a girl comes down with a virus that changes her into a zombie. As her ailments get worse, she dies and is sent to a morgue. During the process of the coroner figuring out what happened to her, she wakes up fully zombied, and kills/eats him. Now, the man investigating the scene (present) is trying to figure out what happened, but can't make sense of it. \n\n\nHad a lot of fun trying to figure this one out, and I hope you enjoyed watching it.

No other special video FX was used as this simple approach was dictated by the overall vibe emanating from that particular creation.\n\nThis vibe, that guided my whole creative process for this special project, is evidently displayed in the intro when the time lapse image of the night sky and Milky Way starts moving when the vocal in the song comes in. This same vibe is in the end scene and it ties the concept of night sky \u0026 sunrise in the intro, with the sunset at the end. The motion of time lapse footage, used in the intro and end scenes, also contributed to further tie the concept together. The visual analogy of the lovers \u0026 trees was also inspired by that vibe.\n\nSince the Edit Challenge Movie Category is limited to 1min 30sec, I edited parts of the song together in Cubase to make it a coherent 1min 17s song, and added a long tunnel-like reverb FX on the vocal for my made-up ending, which extended my edited version of the song to 1min 29s. Since I only had access to a stereo mix of the song (as opposed to the separate multi-tracks), I used iZotope's RX8 to extract and isolate the vocal part and the piano part from that stereo mix, then I was able to apply individual effects on each isolated tracks for my made-up ending. I also remastered the stereo mix, using iZotope's Ozone 9, in order to enhance all the subtleties of the vocal since it was a big part of the overall vibe.\n\n\nFor that ending scene, on the vocal, I used a long tunnel-like reverb-delay with a decay time that matches the motion of the time lapse cloudy sunset footage. For the piano, I used a delay that matched the repetitive motion of the piano, but that had a much shorter decay time. I find that having 2 different decay times (long decay on vocal FX - short decay on piano FX) conveys well the vibe of the tragic separation of the protagonists in my made-up movie trailer. This separation was further enhanced with EQ as I brightened the vocal in the reverb-delay. This bright vocal FX also portrayed well the bright rays of sunlight in the time lapse sunset of that closing scene. As for the piano, I kept a rather muffled EQ for the short delay so that the feeling of separation with the long bright vocal reverb - delay is enhanced.\n\nAll in all, I really enjoyed making this made-up movie in the context of being confined to stock footage and stock music. Being a musician, composer, producer, photographer, videographer, my creative process usually consists of all original material that I create myself, be it original music, video footage, or photography. However, in the case of the ArtGrid x ArtList Edit Challenge, I had to use other people's video footage and music. To navigate this unusual situation for me, my creative process became one of observer, looking at the different stock elements (video and music), feeling their vibe, and following whatever intuitive hunch this vibe was showing me. This lead me to create something that seems to have come \"through me\", as opposed to come \"from me\". I feel like the \"observer mode\" I chose to get into for this special project, and following the intuitive hunches that came out of it, just guided me all along to something much greater than me.\n\nThe resulting video is something that I would probably not have had created if I had approached this special project with a more rational, preconceived frame of mind. I feel that getting into this observer, intuitive approach, and following the vibe of all the stock footage and stock music instead, the whole creative process just came together in a very flowing, organic and cohesive way, and most importantly, resulting with a creation that has \"a soul of its own\", a soul that speaks for itself throughout the whole video I find. Again, this soul emanating from the resulting video came \"through me\", not \"from me\".\n\nSo maybe the lesson here is that we are better off in life stepping back observing things, getting imbued by its vibe, and follow the intuitive guidance that seems to emanate from it, instead of approaching everything with a rational mindset and preconceived ideas focused on a precise anticipated outcome.\n\nLife is full of possibilities, way more than what our mind can conceive, and to me, this video is the proof that if I let go of my preconceptions, then other possibilities (with a soul of its own) emerges.\n\nIt seems that Life just speaks when you leave room for it to manifest.\n\nThanks ArtGrid and ArtList for that opportunity.","ChannelTitle":"Ben Derocks","PublishedDate":"2021-09-23T14:55:36Z","NbLike":1,"NbViews":10,"Duration":92,"ThumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KVqRpLEqaUc/mqdefault.jpg","Theme":"Trailer"},"Ka1OutGWADw":{"Id":"Ka1OutGWADw","Title":"Circle by Luminar (Music Video) Artgrid x Artlist Edit Challenge #AGeditchallenge","Description":"My entry for Artgrid x Artlist Edit Challenge, Music Video Category.\nMusic : Circle by Luminar\n#AGeditchallenge","ChannelTitle":"Mahmoud Khafagy","PublishedDate":"2021-09-23T15:24:10Z","NbLike":2,"NbViews":29,"Duration":210,"ThumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Ka1OutGWADw/mqdefault.jpg","Theme":"MusicClip"},"KfhaFIazdS8":{"Id":"KfhaFIazdS8","Title":"Artgrid x Artlist Edit Challenge’ \u0026 ‘#AGeditchallenge Music Video","Description":"Artgrid x Artlist Edit Challenge 2021\nAugust 23 - September 23","ChannelTitle":"Digital Age Records","PublishedDate":"2021-08-24T20:07:52Z","NbLike":0,"NbViews":161,"Duration":152,"ThumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KfhaFIazdS8/mqdefault.jpg","Theme":"MusicClip"},"Kho2zE2HZf8":{"Id":"Kho2zE2HZf8","Title":"Artgrid x Artlist Edit Challenge / #AGeditchallenge / Brand Ad category by MBM Studios - “Fitamour”","Description":"","ChannelTitle":"MBM Studios","PublishedDate":"2021-09-18T20:44:18Z","NbLike":1,"NbViews":77,"Duration":30,"ThumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Kho2zE2HZf8/mqdefault.jpg","Theme":"Ad"},"KiXclYG_C5g":{"Id":"KiXclYG_C5g","Title":"‘Artgrid x Artlist Edit Challenge’, ‘#AGeditchallenge’, Brand ad","Description":"This 30 seconds video describes how “Defied Odds international,” an imaginary brand has achieved its main objective of ensuring that women across the globe not only try out careers of their choice but also have easy access to opportunities now.  \nArtgrid x Artlist Edit Challenge, #AGeditchallenge","ChannelTitle":"Instic Media","PublishedDate":"2021-09-17T23:04:30Z","NbLike":5,"NbViews":49,"Duration":31,"ThumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KiXclYG_C5g/mqdefault.jpg","Theme":"Ad"},"Kjo2agHaquc":{"Id":"Kjo2agHaquc","Title":"Artgrid x Artlist Edit Challenge | #AGeditchallenge | Movie Trailer","Description":"Movie Trailer, \"The Fourth Planet\", done for ‘Artgrid x Artlist Edit Challenge’ #AGeditchallenge #editchallenge #artgrid #artlist","ChannelTitle":"Aaron Bacus","PublishedDate":"2021-09-23T01:15:17Z","NbLike":2,"NbViews":21,"Duration":91,"ThumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Kjo2agHaquc/mqdefault.jpg","Theme":"Trailer"},"KkaqDW9pj-U":{"Id":"KkaqDW9pj-U","Title":"NEAR | Artgrid x Artlist Edit Challenge | Brand Ad | #AGeditchallenge","Description":"NEAR | Artgrid x Artlist Edit Challenge | Brand Ad | #AGeditchallenge\n\nAplicación para el concurso organizado por Artgrid \u0026 Artlist.\n#AGeditchallenge2021","ChannelTitle":"Alexander Razo","PublishedDate":"2021-09-23T09:12:45Z","NbLike":2,"NbViews":11,"Duration":27,"ThumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KkaqDW9pj-U/mqdefault.jpg","Theme":"Ad"},"KmUyUbzlHCo":{"Id":"KmUyUbzlHCo","Title":"S.O. - Imposters - Artgrid x Artlist Edit Challenge #AGeditchallenge - Music Video","Description":"S.O. - Imposters - Artgrid x Artlist Edit Challenge 2021 #AGeditchallenge - Music Video.","ChannelTitle":"Pablo Rosales","PublishedDate":"2021-09-14T04:52:30Z","NbLike":4,"NbViews":49,"Duration":163,"ThumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KmUyUbzlHCo/mqdefault.jpg","Theme":"MusicClip"},"KmplQ3ZQ3JE":{"Id":"KmplQ3ZQ3JE","Title":"Artgrid x Artlist Edit Challenge // #AGeditchallenge // Movie Trailer // P E G A S U S","Description":"P E G A S U S // Artgrid x Artlist Edit Challenge // #AGeditchallenge // Movie Trailer\n\nCreated using Artgrid and Artlist Resources\n\nTimeline: https://www.instagram.com/p/CUHRT5jF3d6\n\nHi!

There was a unit about Alzheimer’s disease. We looked at an X-ray of a person’s brain with the disease and the brain had dark plaques created by two proteins that disrupt cell function. I thought these plaques looked like black holes. This got me thinking about Einstein’s theory of relativity and that time’s “proteins” would be gravity (gravity creates black holes in time).

This will also inform my cuts in general. \n\nAfter mixing and cutting, I added a bit of ambiance to it with free sound effects from another website and here we are with an ad for MIIL Insurance.\n\n\nFollow me on social media \n\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/fremekwame\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/fremekwame\nInstagram WORK: https://www.instagram.com/kuntuvis\n\n\nWatch my other videos here:\nPlaylist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3LMLQl5Oxo\u0026list=PLrXIu3OHFnt8YrX9BCn-hjqj8Hz950BZZ","ChannelTitle":"Osei Kwame","PublishedDate":"2021-09-01T20:24:38Z","NbLike":39,"NbViews":2080,"Duration":34,"ThumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OWai5lIFtlU/mqdefault.jpg","Theme":"Ad"},"OWfcXa30MAA":{"Id":"OWfcXa30MAA","Title":"Artgrid x Artlist Edit Challenge #AGeditchallenge Brand Ad","Description":"JUST EDIT.","ChannelTitle":"Mahdi Mashto","PublishedDate":"2021-09-23T07:43:25Z","NbLike":0,"NbViews":2,"Duration":58,"ThumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OWfcXa30MAA/mqdefault.jpg","Theme":"Ad"},"OYuNgs6cK28":{"Id":"OYuNgs6cK28","Title":"Artgrid x Artlist Edit Challenge #AGeditchallenge  - Baller","Description":"Artgrid x Artlist Edit Challenge \n#AGeditchallenge \n'Baller'","ChannelTitle":"Wandering Film","PublishedDate":"2021-09-20T02:16:08Z","NbLike":0,"NbViews":12,"Duration":32,"ThumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OYuNgs6cK28/mqdefault.jpg","Theme":"Ad"},"Oac9TI-oA-8":{"Id":"Oac9TI-oA-8","Title":"Artgrid x Artlist Edit Challenge | #AGeditchallenge | Movie Trailer | Justice Riders","Description":"This is my Movie Trailer for the Artgrid x Artlist Edit Challenge 2021!","ChannelTitle":"CM9 Films","PublishedDate":"2021-09-23T05:51:02Z","NbLike":1,"NbViews":19,"Duration":91,"ThumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Oac9TI-oA-8/mqdefault.jpg","Theme":"Trailer"},"OdUXngb_flg":{"Id":"OdUXngb_flg","Title":"Artgrid x Artlist Edit Challenge | #AGeditchallenge | Brand AD | School of dance","Description":"#AGeditchallenge\n Contact info : work@hemantsinghworld.com\n@artgrid.io @artlist.io\n\nInstagram : https://www.instagram.com/cashemant/\r\nFacebook :  https://www.facebook.com/kash.sh.3\r\nWebsite : https://hemantsinghworld.com","ChannelTitle":"HeyMan","PublishedDate":"2021-09-22T05:13:45Z","NbLike":0,"NbViews":33,"Duration":31,"ThumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/OdUXngb_flg/mqdefault.jpg","Theme":"Ad"},"OeB3eN17xDc":{"Id":"OeB3eN17xDc","Title":"Artgrid Photography Awards | Brand AD | EN | Artgrid x Artlist Edit Challenge #ageditchallenge EN","Description":"My english is bad, very bad.

My choice fell on Top shots of Office work by Anna Tolipova. The challenge was to combine the individual scenes into a small story. In order to bring a dynamic into everyday office life, I decided to base the video on slides.\n\nTo increase the dynamic, I used a song with lyrics. My choice fell on \"My Time Is Now\" by Bamtone. \n\n\nFor the slides I use 8 Sets, which are nested in the main composition. Each set includes severals nested shots, which are postioned into the frames to fit the slides. \n\nUnfortunately the number of sequences is limited and I don't want to reuse the same sequences twice. The story would be killed completly. So I decided to shorten the song, but I think you get the idea behind it..\n\nAt the end I added some transitions and text. That's it, I hope you enjoy the video.\n\nIf you want to checkout artlist, please tryout this link: https://artlist.io/Jörg-996540","ChannelTitle":"Jo Zeitler - Fotograf","PublishedDate":"2021-08-28T12:26:21Z","NbLike":7,"NbViews":200,"Duration":74,"ThumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/THUk7pkW3S4/mqdefault.jpg","Theme":"MusicClip"},"TJEm57KH-vI":{"Id":"TJEm57KH-vI","Title":"REVERT | Movie Trailer | Artgrid x Artlist Edit Challenge | #AGeditchallenge","Description":"My movie trailer submission for the Artgrid x Artlist Edit Challenge!

That's because he sees him self as an observer, \"someone who whatches\". And so he gains the thoughts of others, but he doesn't know himself (I've said so many times the word \"himself\")\n\nNext character is the dancer. He was a bit hard to write. So he wants to be a dancer, but he thing that society (Joker) won't accept him. And so he hides himsef \"tring to find something\" and so that's his plot.\n\nAnd now my favourite character. The drug girl (Yeah that's her name) so her story is prety simple, she just wants to escape, but she can't find a way, to encourage herself to do that, and so she goes to drugs and alcohol, she's \"hurting herself\".\n\nThat's it hope you have a great day :)","ChannelTitle":"Marti Milian Yamada","PublishedDate":"2021-09-22T18:47:07Z","NbLike":5,"NbViews":24,"Duration":90,"ThumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VaKbqMpyc0g/mqdefault.jpg","Theme":"Trailer"},"VbqiUoM91-c":{"Id":"VbqiUoM91-c","Title":"Artgrid x Artlist Edit Challenge #AGeditchallenge Lightboys - Brokenhearted Music Video","Description":"#AGeditchallenge\n\nEdit Challenge 2021\nhttps://www.ageditchallenge.io/","ChannelTitle":"RYUSHO","PublishedDate":"2021-09-06T22:16:11Z","NbLike":6,"NbViews":286,"Duration":93,"ThumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VbqiUoM91-c/mqdefault.jpg","Theme":"MusicClip"},"VdtMH4wUpQo":{"Id":"VdtMH4wUpQo","Title":"Artgrid x Artlist Edit Challenge  #AGeditchallenge Brand Ad","Description":"My submission for the AGedit challenge!","ChannelTitle":"Ratul Dutta","PublishedDate":"2021-09-23T10:47:50Z","NbLike":0,"NbViews":5,"Duration":41,"ThumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VdtMH4wUpQo/mqdefault.jpg","Theme":"Ad"},"VfU-mU3vMFs":{"Id":"VfU-mU3vMFs","Title":"Bleeding but Breathing |  Artgrid x Artlist Edit Challenge | #AGeditchallenge | Music Video","Description":"My entry into the #AGEditChallenge, in the 'Music Video' category. \n\nMusic in the Video:\nhttps://artlist.io/song/32902/bleeding-but-breathing\n\nFootages from:\nhttps://artgrid.io/\n\nAdd me on Instagram:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/fortisdeo/","ChannelTitle":"Fortis Deo","PublishedDate":"2021-09-21T14:23:47Z","NbLike":9,"NbViews":95,"Duration":135,"ThumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/VfU-mU3vMFs/mqdefault.jpg","Theme":"MusicClip"},"Vj3pu3H6rjk":{"Id":"Vj3pu3H6rjk","Title":"Doomed Romance | Artgrid x Artlist Edit Challenge | #AGeditchallenge | Music Video","Description":"Stock footage!

But what better time to change that and do it in front of industry-leading creators with the Artgrid x Artlist edit challenge. \n\nAs soon as I saw that challenge, it was clear what song I'd use. A few months back, while work on a Freelance project, I was bouncing back and forth between two-track. Long story short, I saved my favorite track for another occasion. Low and behold, the occasion is here!\n\nEnjoy the energetic, soulful, Cuban-inspired music with a new-age twist. \"Cuban Nights,\" both the title of this video and the title for the song, seamlessly blends classic Rumba with sleek electronic beats.\n\nThe inspiration for the visuals came from my romanticized idea of Havana, Cuba but with a twist just like the music. The decision to include animations was a no-brainer. With its recent inclusion onto the Artgrid platform, I thought it would show the potential of this new category.\n\nThank you for taking the time to watch my submission! It was a fun, creative journey that allowed me to step outside the box of client work and do something different. \n\nVery excited to the all the submissions!!\n\n--\nCaptain Qubz is a Los Angeles-based duo that specializes in music that's tailored for video. After years of working with different artists from all around the globe, the two have found a passion for music for TV and commercials, resulting in creating music for international brands and TV shows.\n\nThe talented Filmmakers behind the footage:\nReeldealHD - (https://artgrid.io/filmmaker/632/reeldealhd)  \nAzulroto - (https://artgrid.io/filmmaker/719/azulroto) \nJessica Peterson - (https://artgrid.io/filmmaker/548/jessica-peterson) Brandon Li - (https://artgrid.io/filmmaker/405/brandon-li)\nMatic Oblak - (https://artgrid.io/filmmaker/483/matic-oblak)\nJakob Owens - (https://artgrid.io/filmmaker/342/jakob-owens) \nMonica Walton - (https://artgrid.io/filmmaker/389/monica-walton)\n\nAnimations:\nShahaf Ram - (https://artgrid.io/filmmaker/724/shahaf-ram)\nPlonter Animation Studio - (https://artgrid.io/filmmaker/739/plonter-animation-studio)\nEisprung Animation Studio - (https://artgrid.io/filmmaker/736/eisprung-animation-studio)\n\nEdited by:\nRio H.

Which is so unimaginable, a world that is specially designed for each individual. Just like living inside the dream. (which they are watching us and keep every detail data for everything to learn about our individual behavior 24/7)\n\nAt first, people only use it for few hours, then a day or 2. They get so addictive. Some of us start to living inside the world until we die.\n\nAnd because of some third-party intervention. The main character finds out the dark side of the corporation's intention and tries to run from it.\n\nBut the virtual reality technology is so advanced. People don't even know what is real and what virtual is anymore, even the main character.\n\nAnd the big corporations let the main character run is just a part of the experiment of human behavior and helps them to find out who is the third party.\n\nAt last, the big corporations lose trace of the third party, so they rewrite the main character’s memories and eliminate the threat.\n\nEverything goes back to normal...\n\nMUSIC FEATURED:\n\"Teché Wé\" Song by A.M.

Easier said than done, because in a movie trailer everything needs to fit together and the story has to make sense. I’ve also used two different songs and many sound effects and scores from Artlist. Everything was made by myself (except the voiceover) and I gave all my best. Reaching the top 3 in this amazing competition would make my dream come true! 😍 \n\nGood luck to all other competitors!

I was suggested Riot by Wes Harris and despite being pressed for time, I listened to the song in its entirety several times and loved it. Again and again I found this song on projects but never used it because it was too emotional and deep. When Artlist \u0026 Artgrid released the #AGeditchallenge, I knew it was my call and I had to make a music video for Riot. After many hours of research on Artgrid, many crushed ideas and hours and hours of editing the video was done and no matter if it ends up in the top 3 places - it's one of my biggest passion projects so far.\n\n\nThanks to Artgrid \u0026 Artlist for this contest and especially to Wes Harris for this song, I must have heard it one hundred times in the last weeks.

For one will scarcely die for a righteous person-- though perhaps for a good person one would dare even to die-- but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Since, therefore, we have now been justified by his blood, much more shall we be saved by Him from the wrath of God.\nEphesians 2:8-9- For by grace you have been saved through faith.  And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast.\nRomans 11:6- But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works; otherwise grace would no longer be grace.\nActs 16:31- And they said, \"Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved...\"\nActs 4:12- \"And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.\"\n\nMusic and footage from Artlist and Artgrid, respectively.","ChannelTitle":"Hattie Waltermire","PublishedDate":"2021-09-21T02:19:13Z","NbLike":2,"NbViews":15,"Duration":101,"ThumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gSNyY0n7PdE/mqdefault.jpg","Theme":"MusicClip"},"gTPWfAVPqMo":{"Id":"gTPWfAVPqMo","Title":"Artgrid x Artlist Edit Challenge | #AGeditchallenge | Movie Trailer | DEATH VALLEY","Description":"This is my entry for the 2021 Artgrid x Artlist Edit challenge. \nEnjoy DEATH VALLEY","ChannelTitle":"Benjamin Weber","PublishedDate":"2021-09-22T07:06:45Z","NbLike":0,"NbViews":7,"Duration":91,"ThumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/gTPWfAVPqMo/mqdefault.jpg","Theme":"Trailer"},"gVK_aTUWaMM":{"Id":"gVK_aTUWaMM","Title":"Take The Shot Artgrid x Artlist Edit Challenge #AGeditchallenge Music Video","Description":"music video I created for the Artgrid and Artlist Edit competition.\nThe song and the images resonated with me because I work as a still photographer and videographer, and often work with models.\nI chose to stay with one main contributor for most of the footage because I wanted the consistency of the look in creating the story.

Figured its more easier for me to listen to the beats with rap music so when with it. Ended up picking this song, which is quite a nice song.\n\nRealized halfway that kinda when overboard with the effects (haha got carried away) and end up didn't tell much of a story.\n\nWanted to show different people doing different stuff of their own, to show the \"yeah thats me!\" feeling.\nAlso added in random people acting cool moment cause in suits the rap video vibe.\n\nMostly edit in Ae and added the sounds later in Premiere.\n\nHope you enjoyed.

Connection, love, and optimism are the three main themes.\n \nThe original concept for the visual story came from the quote that I included in the video \"Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.\" \n\nMusic is always a source of inspiration for me creatively. The song Love of Mine, by The Hunts inspired me from the moment I first heard it. It's a beautiful song that has moments of excitement and reflection, and that's before even hearing the first verse of the lyrics. The lyrics themselves seem to tell a story of unconditional love and devotion. \n\nSo, a project combining themes of connection, love, and optimism with a song about love and devotion. Suffice it to say, it was an absolute pleasure to create.\n\n- Thank you!\n\nThe Hunts (YouTube Channel): https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1q2D_kJ3MV6hJCY481JbwQ\nThe Hunts - Love of Mine (Official Audio): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lplqs8ng8q8\nThe Hunts (Website): https://www.thehuntsmusic.com\nRoyalty-Free Music Source: Artlist.io\nStock Video Footage Source: Artgrid.io\n\nThank you to all of the content creators for making your beautiful work available for other artists to showcase.

The #AGeditchallenge is an editing challenge where participants are required to ONLY USE stock footage from Artgrid and music from Artlist. Everything else (sound design, color grading, voiceovers, titles, etc) is up to the participant. Peeps can choose to make a music video, a brand ad, or a movie trailer. I chose the movie trailer option and actually had the most fun I've had editing in awhile. It brought me back to my childhood days of putting together action movies with my brothers and cousin.\n\nThe time limit for the movie trailer was 1:30 which I found to be quite a challenge. There were so many areas in the edit I really needed space for the edit to breathe, but I had to make cuts to fit it in the max duration. The premise is a little cliche and cheesy, but I felt I did the best I could with random stock clips. I hope you enjoy!

If I could allocate time and budget, I would have loved to get Voice artists involved in this.\n\nIt was an amazing experience, pulling all nighters and trying my hand at. voice acting. I used https://www.voicebooking.com for some of my characters lines and my very talented wife Lisa, (http://instagram.com/lsmcolquhoun) who put up with the late nights working on this after hours.\n\nThank you Artgrid and Artlist for this opportunity.

If I win the prize it will jump start my career in film and stop motion animation, I have so many stories I want to tell. \n\nThis made-up trailer is about a small platoon getting injected with an advanced A.I. system, but little do they know that movement they do is being controlled by a computer operator. Will they find out the truth and break free from their control? Or will they fail and be the government’s expensive property for years to come?\n\nI wanted to stay under the 90 second time frame, for the fear of being disqualified. I know how it is to view a lot of clips, those extra 2 or 3 seconds can add up. It was very difficult cutting footage out but I managed to do so. Overall it was very fun! I wish everyone good luck and hope they had fun in this challenge.

I learned a ton about making a music video. For example, I thought that the clips should be cut to the beat of the music, but after watching several professionally produced music videos, I found that none of them do. So I did my second cut of the clips by feel, and the result is way better than when lined up with the rhythm. That surprised me!\n\nLyrics:\nYou can't me break my focus\nAll I got right now is attention\nGimme that divine intervention\nYou done got me started\nNow every day is just a beginning\nTake it to the bank, now I'm winning\n\nCall me crazy, tell me lies\nIt won't stop me, watch me rise\nNo more anchors holdin' me down\nNow all I need is more\n\nOne more hour, one more minute\nOne more chance for me to win it\nYeah I - I - I want more\nEvery time I dream, I catch it\nI know how to make it happen\nBut I - I - I want more\n\nClimbing every mountain\nKeep both eyes on the top (on the top)\nNothin's going to tell me to stop (never stop)\nPush me through the fire\nAll I'm going to feel is the heat\nBurning underneath of my feet\n\nCall me crazy, tell me lies\nIt won't stop me, watch me rise\nNo more anchors holdin' me down\n'Cause all I need is more\n\nOne more hour, one more minute\nOne more chance for me to win it\nYeah I - I - I want more\nEvery time I dream, I catch it\nI know how to make it happen\nBut I - I - I want more\nI - I - I - I want more\n\nAll I need is, all I need is\nAll I need is more\nAll I need is, all I need is\nMore, more, more\nAll I need is, all I need is\nAll I need is more\nAll I need is, all I need is\nAll I need is more\n\nOne more hour, one more minute\nOne more chance for me to win it\nYeah I - I - I want more\nEvery time I dream, I catch it\nI know how to make it happen\nBut I - I - I want more\nI - I - I - I want more\nI want more\nI - I - I want more","ChannelTitle":"Jack Smith","PublishedDate":"2021-09-21T17:08:56Z","NbLike":3,"NbViews":36,"Duration":191,"ThumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yGW9Iwqm_fM/mqdefault.jpg","Theme":"MusicClip"},"yHUehIeH0qc":{"Id":"yHUehIeH0qc","Title":"“Travel to a another planet” editing challenge with stock footage it (#AGeditchallenge )","Description":"This video is not full compensation to artgrid.io and also artlist.io i do not own the stock footage and music to the video disclaimers I hope artlist and \n\n\nartgrid would allow me to use their footage music for my youtube channel\n\n \n\nPlease check out artgrid.io here : https://artgrid.io/  \n\n\nAlso for the soundtrack and music and sound from artlist.io here : https://artlist.io/ \n\n\n\nAlso to stock footage owners on the artlist.io and artgrid.io i sincerly hope i \n\n\nhope i can use this sound and footage \n\n\n\nPlease also check out my main gaming youtube channel here : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMbXl7cOHhvKFaFy4_Lpgxw\n\n\nAlso join the base here for this channel here : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxZ7aPObwWkJ53nWTcT6Hig\n\n\n\n\nThank you all for watching this was my first ever video on this channel please subscribe and like and also comment if you like \n\n\n\nTell me in the comment what videos you like to watch next \n\n\n\n#AGeditchallenge also ageditchallenge.io\n\n\n\n\nSee you on the next video !!!","ChannelTitle":"God Like","PublishedDate":"2021-09-03T23:21:37Z","NbLike":3,"NbViews":53,"Duration":85,"ThumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yHUehIeH0qc/mqdefault.jpg","Theme":"Trailer"},"yNlWw2iTA8A":{"Id":"yNlWw2iTA8A","Title":"Artgrid x Artlist Edit Challenge - Brief Goat - Music Video - #AGeditchallenge","Description":"This is my music video submission for the Artgrid x Artlist Edit Challenge 2021.

In the future, I'm planning to work more on ads. I love projects that demand my creativity! I'm still working on my expression voice as an artist and developing my skills with any new project that comes. \n\nI got the idea for this Ad in the middle of the night, when I woke up suddenly and couldn't fall asleep again. I was thinking: what if you could choose who you want to be once in a while? Discover life from different perspectives, cultures, and places. Respecting each body you are in and build a beautiful utopian world. \nI hope this Brand Ad reflects my idea and convincing you to use NewYou's product!\n\nI'm happy with all footage I found in Artgrid. First, I chose the song I liked, created visuals, and added all SFX with a few robotic voices a la Siri commands. But after reviewing the video with my dear friends and gathering their comments, I decided to add an authentic voice (VO) to explain the process. \n\nFollow me on Instagram: @visualbeesy\nHere is the
