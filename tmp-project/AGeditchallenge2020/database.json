Just made my first one for an online contest. The main rule is to only use stock music and footage from artlist.io. This was fun! ‚ò∫Ô∏è\n\nIs dancing a sport? Put on your dancing shoes and find out. Dancing near me might get you on the big screen! Usually, I'm just dancing with myself or dancing by myself hahaha! If you like to dance you'll probably like this video with dancing moves and dancing music and people of course dancing to songs. Hope you enjoy my dancing video! :) \n\nAlso, notice the minimalist video editing style I used haha. I tried not to use many transitions so the stock video footage and music could do their thing for this challenge. Artlist.io has been my goto for music in my videos. I might consider getting a subscription for their stock footage as well. It helps to have a video editing pc for sure. I don't have much of a video editing background in a professional sense but I have been playing around with cameras from an early age. \n\n#AGeditchallenge\nMusic Video\n\"Mythologica\" by Ofrin","ChannelTitle":"Jacob Walker","PublishedDate":"2020-09-08T04:24:08Z","NbLike":3,"NbViews":191,"Duration":158,"ThumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-F1k6I_eyEw/mqdefault.jpg","Theme":"MusicClip"},"-Hs23IX030E":{"Id":"-Hs23IX030E","Title":"A HOSTAGE'S REVENGE / Movie Treiler/ #AGEditChallenge","Description":"This is my trailer for the #AGEditChallenge, in the 'Movie Trailer' category. \n\nAll the footage, soundtrack and SFX used in this trailer was provided by Artgrid and Artlist:\nhttps://artlist.io/\nhttps://artgrid.io/\n \nI FROM BRAZIL AND I LOVE MAKE VIDEOS!\nMY INSTAGRAM  @heitor_noguera","ChannelTitle":"Makecine Produ√ß√µes","PublishedDate":"2020-09-21T09:25:18Z","NbLike":3,"NbViews":49,"Duration":91,"ThumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-Hs23IX030E/mqdefault.jpg","Theme":"Trailer"},"-KLnWDy4NC4":{"Id":"-KLnWDy4NC4","Title":"TO DUST | MOVIE TRAILER | #AGeditchallenge","Description":"My entry into the #AGEditChallenge,  'Movie Trailer' category. \n\nThis trailer was made using stock footage from ArtGrid and music from ArtList.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CFG7d9iJ-TB/","ChannelTitle":"Daniel Struthers","PublishedDate":"2020-09-13T12:09:03Z","NbLike":20,"NbViews":264,"Duration":83,"ThumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-KLnWDy4NC4/mqdefault.jpg","Theme":"Trailer"},"-ZOWpfJI92A":{"Id":"-ZOWpfJI92A","Title":"WHO WILL CAUGHT ME | MOVIE TRAILER | #AGeditchallenge","Description":"IN THIS VIDEO I DONE MY BEST.\nFOOTAGE TAKEN FROM ARTGRID\nAND\nAUDIO TAKEN FROM ARTLIST\nFOLLOW ME ON INSTA \n@UVRAJSSPECIAL","ChannelTitle":"khel khiladi","PublishedDate":"2020-08-22T04:26:51Z","NbLike":244,"NbViews":1261,"Duration":90,"ThumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-ZOWpfJI92A/mqdefault.jpg","Theme":"Trailer"},"-cV_QHqvojo":{"Id":"-cV_QHqvojo","Title":"Collide | Stock Movie Trailer | #AGeditchallenge","Description":"Movie trailer for a fictional movie about two alternate realities colliding.

To lose awareness of these five values is to lose our humanity.\nThe five universal human values are within us. They reside in the seat of our soul, in\nour heart. The highest aim of education and our human experience is to elicit these\nvalues from within and to manifest them in all our interactions and experiences\nwith other people and our environment, or Nature and Mother Earth. In this way,\nwe begin to experience the Truth that we are in reality spiritual beings having a\nhuman experience.\nWhen we live our life in tune with the universal human values, Mother Earth is\nsustained and protected.\nTherefore, to protect Mother Earth we must first understand these values and then\nlearn how to practise them in all that we think and do.

It includes television programs that glorify violence, It grows with the equipment that the police use to quell the riots, and it increases when on their ashes the popular slums are rebuilt.\nGDP does not take into account the health of our families, the quality of their education or the joy of their leisure time. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the solidity of family values, the intelligence of our debate or the honesty of our civil servants. It takes no account of justice in our courts, nor of fairness in our dealings.\nGDP measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our knowledge, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country. It measures everything, in short, except what makes life truly worth living.\"","ChannelTitle":"Marco Andriolo","PublishedDate":"2020-09-07T08:04:49Z","NbLike":30,"NbViews":254,"Duration":90,"ThumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3qtNr1Wgo_0/mqdefault.jpg","Theme":"Trailer"},"3t14ujxn4Ok":{"Id":"3t14ujxn4Ok","Title":"The Conservatoire | Movie Trailer | #AGeditchallenge","Description":"To succeed at the most exclusive art school in the world, these students will definitely need the stomach for it.

Please use your headphones to listen to the beautiful song. \n\nI am really excited for this unique video editing competition where you get to edit best quality footage and audio and use your creativity at it's best and come up with a video. \n\nWhile editing this video I had following things in my mind(in order of priority)\n1. Storyline - Wanted it to be meaningful, slow paced and beautiful to watch. I have tried my best to give a visual meaning to every line of the song and create a beautiful love story of couples on a perfect date. Travel along with them from beautiful afternoon till magnificent sunset. \n2. Audio - But obvious, it's a music video :) Finding out a perfect track is the key. Spent considerable time to find out the track which will complement the story.\n3. Colors - The theme of the song itself is \"on fire\". Vibrant Orange was bound to dominate across frames. Apart from that, I paid attention to color correction and grading wherever needed to maintain consistency.\n4. Very subtle use of VFX / SFX - I believe in \"less is more\". It is specially true for this song. A music video should not loose focus from it's core i.e. \"music\" and in many cases sound effects and transitions overpower the fact. At no point, you will be distracted from this fantastic song. \n\nIf you like this video and want to subscribe to Artlist(which you should), please use below referral link.

So, it might be not perfect because I had no more time for any corrections and the upload finished literally the last minute before closing time, but this is a topic very important to me. I really hope to realize this project one day to drive awareness regarding the effects of narcissistic abuse. Especially for people that never experienced it themselves it‚Äôs hard to understand and emphasize with victims and survivors. \n\nPlease leave me a thumbs up! üëç \n\n-----\n\nWhat is narcissistic abuse? \n\nNarcissistic abuse is covert, and often disguised as love and care, but it‚Äôs anything but. It‚Äôs not a single act of cruelty like an insulting comment, or verbal abuse laced with a string of profanities. It‚Äôs the insidious, gradual, and intentional erosion of a person‚Äôs sense of self-worth. It‚Äôs a combination of emotional and psychological abuse aimed at undermining a person‚Äôs identity for the sole purpose of obtaining control for personal gain.\n\nThe emotional damage caused by narcissistic abuse is cumulative, which is one of the reasons why the abuse is so hard to pinpoint. We often don‚Äôt recognize or become alarmed at what appears small and innocuous in a particular moment. Most of us subscribe to the mantra: ‚ÄúNo one is perfect.‚Äù We don‚Äôt suspect we‚Äôre being used, deceived, or conned. We assume the best intentions from the people who claim to love us. The lack of public awareness and education blinds us from seeing the pieces of our self-esteem and identity slowly being chipped away.  \n\nMany people who‚Äôve experienced domestic violence will tell you that the emotional and psychological abuse that is characteristic of narcissistic abuse is more painful and lingering than the pain of physical abuse. But it‚Äôs much harder and takes a lot longer to heal a broken spirit than it is to heal a black eye.\n\nIt‚Äôs challenging enough to try to describe what narcissistic abuse is, but even more challenging to try to spark the concern of people who haven‚Äôt experienced it. Some may feel they are too smart or too strong for it to ever happen to them, or impact their life in any way.\n\nA commonly held misconception is that only weak-minded, fragile, co-dependent types are vulnerable to being abused. Sadly, this stereotype only intensifies the danger of the current lack of public awareness, and provides a false sense of protection.\n\nThe damage caused by narcissistic abuse is not limited to the individual victim. It bleeds into society, and impacts us all. \n\n- Bree Boncha\n\nhttps://psychcentral.com/lib/narcissistic-abuse-affects-over-158-million-people-in-the-u-s/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20Diagnostic%20Statistical,as%20high%20as%206%25%20percent.\n______\n\nEmail: contact@personalcontrasts.com\nRelease date: 20.09.2020\n\nMusic from Artlist.io by Ian Post\nNarcissus by Maya Belsitzman \u0026 Matan Ephrat  https://artlist.io/song/36459/knocked\n\nVideo scenes from ArtGrid.io by\nAmi Bornstein\nBlue Ridge Film\nLiran Friedman\nMiky Wajnerman\nOmri Ohana\nPiotrek Naumowicz\nYigal Ohanna\n\n----\n#narcissism #narcissist #narcissisticabuse #gaslighting #emotionalabuse #narcissisticabusesurvivor #narcissists \n----\n\nFOLLOW ME\nInstagram ‚ñ∫ https://bit.ly/2IBeqVp\nFacebook  ‚ñ∫ https://bit.ly/2ZfurWL","ChannelTitle":"Personal Contrasts","PublishedDate":"2020-09-20T14:56:30Z","NbLike":27,"NbViews":1045,"Duration":89,"ThumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LRMc_8Q9gQY/mqdefault.jpg","Theme":"Trailer"},"LSZxD9nLM3g":{"Id":"LSZxD9nLM3g","Title":"#AGeditchallenge | The People of The Forest (Movie Trailer)","Description":"This movie trailer is my submission to the ArtGrid Edit Challenge 2020.","ChannelTitle":"Alexia Holanda","PublishedDate":"2020-09-20T04:53:24Z","NbLike":145,"NbViews":426,"Duration":90,"ThumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LSZxD9nLM3g/mqdefault.jpg","Theme":"Trailer"},"LU4OhjE7kNA":{"Id":"LU4OhjE7kNA","Title":"Story of a Hero | Music Video | #AGeditchallenge","Description":"Story of a Hero was born when I hear the song of Max H. for the first time, the song was able to generate many emotions that could intensify with the power of image.

I did the job this morning in a French hospital ward where I spent about five hours for a blood treatment. The best way to keep mentally sane under such circumstances  is to bring over one's laptop (or tablet) and use it as a creative tool. Thanks to Artlist-Artgrid.io's impressive database, creating this \"fake\" ad was a breeze for me. One my nurses did the voice-over using my smartphone as a mic and sound editing device. Since the theme of the ad is Cupid and his/her bow and arrow (Greek mythology -- check it out on wikipedia) to promote an imagined \"organic\" cosmetic brand based in Paris. In order to keep the process/workflow simple and stupid (remember the aptly named KISS acronym?) I used the basic preloaded iMovie editing suite that came with the small MacBook Air I carry with me most of the time. Suddenly I'm feeling tired. More on this later ‚Äî or tomorrow...\n\nOh, just one more thing: the score I used is by Roman P and the title is \"Up To The Sky\".

When I found out about it, I figured it wouldn't hurt to enter it into the contest. \n\n***Script\n\nMy head hurts. \nI‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs from sickness or late night sobbing.\nI‚Äôm standing in the kitchen. \nChemex coffee pot bubbling and dripping.\n195 degree water over coffee from Minnesota.\nI don‚Äôt want to write or think or feel.\nConsenting to these peels the neatly sealed scab of sleep from the wound.\n‚ÄúI feel like you don‚Äôt even see me most of the time you‚Äôre home; like I‚Äôm an object to be navigated around.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs because you are. You‚Äôre in the way. You‚Äôre just a problem to be dealt with. Instead of a responsible adult and a real human being.‚Äù\nThat‚Äôll sting for awhile.\nOur youngest son was having trouble breathing and we were both tired.\nWe worked it out.\nThen it happened again.\nPoignant phrases concealed and compressed over time to form sharp edges. \nShe didn‚Äôt hold back.\nI admit it, I flipped.\nI left the room.\nI yelled.\nI swore.\nI threw a water bottle.\n‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to deal with your drama. Go write a song, or talk to someone else.‚Äù\nHollowed out, I walked out of the room just a body with two pillows and a blanket.\nThen I collapsed in the middle of the basement floor.\nAnd I cried.\nMy headache is probably from both. Sickness and sobbing.\nThe congestion betrays the sickness, my red eyes the sobbing.\nMy hands and feet went limp on the carpet‚Äîthat predominating feeling radiated from my chest.\nEverything closed in on me.\nTrapped.\nI wandered around, for a moment, betraying my fear and indecision.\n‚ÄúWe are better without you; you‚Äôre bringing me down; you‚Äôre so much work. It‚Äôs better when you‚Äôre not here‚Äù \nShe didn‚Äôt say these last night but it‚Äôs not a far leap.\nAnd she‚Äôs said it a few times before.\nHow is someone supposed to bury such words? Just take it she‚Äôd say.\nThe only way out was sleep.\nSleep and death are similar: except you don‚Äôt wake up from the latter. And I wasn‚Äôt sure I wanted to wake up.\nIt‚Äôs 8:45a the day after.\nI spent thirty minutes reading about the suicide hotline and another thirty debating on whether to call.\nI was rational and lucid.\nI recognized those feelings for what they were but I needed to talk because I needed to sleep.\nAnd I didn‚Äôt have anyone that would listen.\nI called.\nWe spoke for an hour. \nAnd then I fell asleep.","ChannelTitle":"WholesomeHenri","PublishedDate":"2020-09-10T04:24:39Z","NbLike":41,"NbViews":176,"Duration":196,"ThumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MchDZdtFvp0/mqdefault.jpg","Theme":"MusicClip"},"MnaQ2XtSFW0":{"Id":"MnaQ2XtSFW0","Title":"Zombies from space trailer #AGeditchallenge","Description":"#AGeditchallenge","ChannelTitle":"Sebasti√°n Vera Miranda","PublishedDate":"2020-09-20T00:58:47Z","NbLike":0,"NbViews":6,"Duration":51,"ThumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MnaQ2XtSFW0/mqdefault.jpg","Theme":"Trailer"},"MpGGtysOoLE":{"Id":"MpGGtysOoLE","Title":"Trailer THE LAST SEAL #AGeditchallenge","Description":"#AGeditchallenge\n\nTrailer THE LAST SEAL #AGeditchallenge","ChannelTitle":"Sergio Paz","PublishedDate":"2020-09-01T17:33:46Z","NbLike":104,"NbViews":885,"Duration":92,"ThumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/MpGGtysOoLE/mqdefault.jpg","Theme":"Trailer"},"MpeDaRifhpY":{"Id":"MpeDaRifhpY","Title":"SPORTENVY | SPORTS AD | #AGeditchallenge","Description":"Our advisement entry for the #artgrideditchallenge. \" SPORTENVY\" features 10 video clips and 3 audio/SFX files from the Artgrid/Artlist library.

This also allows the audience to engage with the product emotionally.\nWhile I originally played with grading everything similarly, I removed most of this as it makes sense that people's memories have different tones and feelings, but I have chosen clips that still work well together.\nOnce I had a look at what was available to come up with my concept, the huge array of stock footage meant I could write my script and then find the shots that told the story just right.\nI wanted this to be soft and simple - it encapsulated my work in video and photography but I made up a photobook business within which to hide my ethos.","ChannelTitle":"Suzanne Was Here","PublishedDate":"2020-09-19T07:51:59Z","NbLike":82,"NbViews":503,"Duration":30,"ThumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q_XFD7r5PPk/mqdefault.jpg","Theme":"Ad"},"QbI6FGxCwKg":{"Id":"QbI6FGxCwKg","Title":"Blood Lines #AGeditChallenge (Movie Trailer)","Description":"Blood Lines. \n#AGeditChallenge\nMovie Trailer.\nArtlist \u0026 Artgrid","ChannelTitle":"Dixan Garrido","PublishedDate":"2020-09-02T02:32:54Z","NbLike":86,"NbViews":504,"Duration":84,"ThumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/QbI6FGxCwKg/mqdefault.jpg","Theme":"Trailer"},"QhwqZNXaJ9Q":{"Id":"QhwqZNXaJ9Q","Title":"#AGeditchallenge Se d√©placer en v√©lo","Description":"Salutüëã\n voici ma vid√©o de participation au concours #AGeditchallenge.

I am competing in the #AGeditchallenge. The rules are simple. Edit any music video using only Artlist's music and Artgrid's stock footage. As I'm not subscribed to their services, I had to use the watermarked music and footage. I'm sorry if you find that distracting.\n\nWhen I thought of making a music video, this was my approach: Music have such an amazing way to give energy, inspiration and motivation to us. Is music physically helping you to achieve a goal? Maybe not. But in some way, we can all agree that music helps. So in this video, you can see all the things that gets amplified by the power of music!\n\nI really hope to win this competition, so please like and share this video to increase my chances of winning! \n\nYou guys are the best!

Brand Ad.","Description":"Ganso Rojo - Sportswear Commercial.\n\n#AGeditchallenge #GansoRojo #Commercial\n\nA made-up sportswear brand ad. If it was real, it would be nice to think that this company was started by some Spanish guy from a poor family, who ran to the free tennis courts after school.  And perfected his skills, sweating on hot Spanish sun, approaching to the adult players and asking them to play with him, and did that without considering his young age, no indulgences. Thus, he played with the best, stronger opponents every time honing his knowledge about this sport. He didn't have the best equipment and clothes: his racket was old and you could have seen that it was fixed several times, his sneakers were shabby and his T-shirt has already lost its saturated colours. Years went by and one day he was noticed by a local coach, playing against a one really good adult player. Although kid lost this close match, the coach noticed his stubborn character and pushy style of play, kid kept high pressure on his skilful opponent throughout the whole game. So, the coach talked to him and proposed to train him for free and even bought him new clothes. In several years this kid has become a true legend, having won many prestigious games and competitions. After the war, where he fought as bravely as he played tennis, he started his own company in 1947. \nNow, I should write a full-length script about this guy, could be a nice screen story)\n\n‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢\nLittle behind the scenes of brand creating:\n\n1. What does the brand name mean? - It's \"red/orange/ginger goose\" in Spanish. The first names were completely different: lots of variations and languages, including Latin. \n2. Why this colour - red/orange/ginger? -  My favourite colour.\n3. Why goose? - I love its character: they will not surrender until their enemies are gone or defeated, no matter what size they are. Those birds will chase you like crazy. They have the courage and a handful of impudence to keep on pushing no matter what, and those traits are crucial in tennis and any other highly competitive sport.\n4. Why origami? - First drafts of the logo were completely different (more real images of different geese) and I was experimenting till I've come across that origami idea, which, to my taste, suites sportswear brand perfectly: it's laconic and looks like it belongs on sports clothes. At least, I would buy something like that)\n4. Why in Spanish? - I just love that language, still learning it though)\n5. Why Tennis? - It's simple, I just love everything about it.\n6. Why Ad.? - I Already have two music videos and one fake movie trailer on my channel. So, I thought this challenge is the perfect time to try my skills in ad-making. Plus, I love cinematic commercials.\n\n‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢\n\nSUBSCRIBE\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOLv5GQA1y2YGb_Neb-fDyg?sub_confirmation=1 \n\n‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢‚óè‚Ä¢\n\nCREDITS: \nFootages, music, SFX: Artgrid \u0026 Artlist\nThumbnail: Borg McEnroe ¬© SF Studios Production AB, Danish Film Institute, Film i V√§st\nFootage used: #Tennis #Sewing #Scissors #WeavingMachine #Eye #Explosion #Sun \u0026 others\nMusic used: Paradiddles by Ian Post\nSFX used: #Tennis #TennisBall #TennisRacket","ChannelTitle":"Movie Whisperer","PublishedDate":"2020-09-08T19:51:12Z","NbLike":24,"NbViews":819,"Duration":30,"ThumbnailUrl":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/tEVG7TRaWck/mqdefault.jpg","Theme":"Ad"},"tKJnrLNfYEw":{"Id":"tKJnrLNfYEw","Title":"#AGEditChallenge - ùóú ùóûùó°ùóòùó™ | ùòîùò∂ùò¥ùò™ùò§ ùòùùò™ùò•ùò¶ùò∞","Description":"My submission for the 2020 ArtGrid Editing Challenge.
