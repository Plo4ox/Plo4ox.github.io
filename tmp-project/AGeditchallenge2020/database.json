Armed with a limited supply, the US prioritizes its’ own citizens to receive the vaccine, causing political and diplomatic turmoil with other nations. Plagued by the virus more than any, a nation state declares war on the US by attacking the United States’ Capitol Building. With more than 1/2 of congress killed in the attack, the future of the United States is uncertain. The country is now in a state of peril.\n\nWritten by Tim DeBerry\nEdited by Tim DeBerry\nIn association with Artlist.io / Artgrid.io \n\nMusic: Attack on London by C.K.

      "Description": "I enjoyed very much putting together this ad (or \"advert\" as they say in the Brexit Isles) for the Artlist-Artgrid editing challenge. I did the job this morning in a French hospital ward where I spent about five hours for a blood treatment. The best way to keep mentally sane under such circumstances  is to bring over one's laptop (or tablet) and use it as a creative tool. Thanks to Artlist-Artgrid.io's impressive database, creating this \"fake\" ad was a breeze for me. One my nurses did the voice-over using my smartphone as a mic and sound editing device. Since the theme of the ad is Cupid and his/her bow and arrow (Greek mythology -- check it out on wikipedia) to promote an imagined \"organic\" cosmetic brand based in Paris. In order to keep the process/workflow simple and stupid (remember the aptly named KISS acronym?) I used the basic preloaded iMovie editing suite that came with the small MacBook Air I carry with me most of the time. Suddenly I'm feeling tired. More on this later — or tomorrow...\n\nOh, just one more thing: the score I used is by Roman P and the title is \"Up To The Sky\". I only kept the last movement of this uplifting theme in G.",

CBD’s therapeutic applications are many (anti-stress, pain relief) and ways to use are varied (vape, tea, baked goods, and more).\n\nBut, how many people can say they know where their supply is grown, and that they bought it straight from the grower?\n\nBritten’s latest greenhouse venture is hemp, including CBD buds. Take a look at this intimate little short film to experience the journey up close. Website: www.brittensgreenhouse.com\n\nVideo shot and edited by Samuel Karow.",

We had to use only Artgrid.io stock footage and Artlist.io music to create a 30 second made up brand ad. It was challenging yet so rewarding. We created an ad for a made up luxury watch company 'TIMOL' with a story involving two lovers when they were young and now old. This idea of timeless love embodies what TIMOL watches represent. This #ageditchallenge has given us the opportunity to present our skills in editing, brand content creation and storytelling.  Please enjoy this 30 SECOND BRAND AD for the made up TIMOL luxury watch brand. \n\nTHANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.
